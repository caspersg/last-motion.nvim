# last-motion.nvim
Repeat the last motion or reverse the last motion in Neovim

# TODO
- comment out hjkl, just like with jumplists they're too noisy
- recent motions
    - add a numbered stack of the recent motions 0-9
    - add ,0-9 to use them
    - :motions
- or save last to a named register "," to make it available
    - is there a way to make a namespace for registers? so ,0-,9 ?
- recent edits
    - Is there similar for . repeat? show the recent edits and allow to pick from them
